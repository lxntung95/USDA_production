DESCRIPTION

    The USDA has been tracking the production of various agricultural commodities across different states (milk, cheese, coffee, honey, yogurt, and state lookups). The data spans multiple years and states, with varying levels of production for each commodity.

    These queries generate insights to aid in future planning and decision-making.

    Objectives:
    - Use csv files to create various commodity production tables in the database.
    - Clean the data in the newly produced production tables.
    - Assess state-by-state production for each commodity.
    - Identify trends or anomalies.
    - Offer data-backed suggestions for areas that may need more attention.
